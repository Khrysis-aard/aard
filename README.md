# plugins

ft2_portal plugin ------> has riddles built in so no need for both plugins but Thief class is required for functionality to work                                           

wid plugin -------------> keeps idnumbers for won and woff variables updated as you equip new weapons          

Vlad autoloot plugin --> tells helpfile command on plugin install when you load client and should no longer have autoloot off automatically when first load client       

RNametoGMCP -------> added on plugin install message to tell toggle on/off commands that are slightly different from the way Crowley has it but no double descriptions

Practice_all_or_list ----> gives you two lists to add spells/skills too and command to for each one to compare to practice list to practice or all cmd for both
